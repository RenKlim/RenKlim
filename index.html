<p>I completely understand and appreciate that not everyone is in a position to donate at the moment (cue rant about COVID, cost of living, etc etc), but I have a three part request that I would appreciate people doing the parts which they are able. I&#39;m also including the story behind this below, however I would like to warn you that some readers may find this distressing and I will understand if you don&#39;t read further than my 3 requests.</p>
<p>1) Make a donation! I&#39;m raising money for the Source of Light Nursery and Primary School in Uganda via the charity All Our Children (<a href="naomihaigh.muchloved.com/Fundraising/RaisedForCharity/644234212">donate here</a>)</p>
<p>2) Reconnect with a friend you haven&#39;t spoken to in a while and find out how they&#39;re doing. Share some memories with them, and see if you can make some new ones.</p>
<p>3) Look after yourself. If you find that you&#39;ve been struggling in the present day, you&#39;re not alone. Talk to a friend or a doctor and get the support that you need.</p>
<p>Many of you will be aware that I shaved my head in 2014 for Cancer Research. As soon as I mentioned that I was planning to do this, Naomi jumped in and asked if she could shave her head with me. And so began the big plan. We waited until we both had hair long enough to donate to <a href="www.littleprincesses.org.uk">The Little Princess Trust</a> who make and provide wigs for children who lost their hair due to cancer and other illnesses. I chose to raise funds for Cancer Research and Naomi, having recently visited Uganda, choose to collect donations for Source of Light, who I am raising money for this time around.</p>
<p><a href="www.allourchildren.co.uk/post/the-source-of-light-nursery-and-primary-school-mubende-uganda">Source of Light</a> was set up with Naomi&#39;s founding donations. Since helping start the school, Naomi continued to fundraise with numerous events, raising tens of thousands of pounds, which went towards various necessities, primarily buildings.</p>
<p>Naomi was always a giver, and felt the world&#39;s problems as her own. In September 2021 Naomi killed herself, having struggled with her mental health over a long period. She was 28 and had only recently started to get medical help. In death she continued to help others, as several of her organs were successfully donated.</p>
<p>Almost a year later, I still cannot quite believe that I will never see Naomi again, even though we had not been in contact for some time before her death. I wish I could tell her what her friendship means to me, despite this, and hope that some of you are encouraged by this to reach out to those you haven&#39;t heard from in a while and check in with them.</p>
<p>If you are in a position to donate, please do so via <a href="naomihaigh.muchloved.com/Fundraising/RaisedForCharity/644234212">Naomi&#39;s memorial page</a> - any donations made will continue the good work that she started. Please be aware that I do not have control over this website - notifications will go to Naomi&#39;s family. Regardless of whether or not I manage to thank you personally, I am grateful for anything that you are able to spare to this cause!</p>
